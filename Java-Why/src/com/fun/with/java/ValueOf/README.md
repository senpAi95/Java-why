# valueOf

Integer.valueOf

* Returns an {@code Integer} instance representing the specified {@code int} value. If a new {@code Integer} instance is
 not required, this method should generally be used in preference to the constructor {@link #Integer(int)}, as this 
 method is likely to yield significantly better space and time performance by caching frequently requested values.
